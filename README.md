## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)

## Notes

* Swift is new to me. I have to get used to Swift, not only the language but also the libraries.
* The story board is a little tricky at first. After I am familiar with it, it is a lot of fun. I have quite a few experience in Android development. They are similar in many ways. On the other hand, they are different in many ways.
